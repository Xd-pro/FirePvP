# FirePvP
A PvP Client and Mod Loader for Minecraft Windows 10 Edition written in AHK (and some json for a resource pack, but mostly ahk)

# Default Mods Are Closed-Source
You can make mods easily using autohotkey scripts! More Info -> https://github.com/Xd-pro/FirePvP/wiki/How-To-Make-Mods

# How to compile
Press the windows key and type ahk2exe. Press enter and a program will come up if you have ahk installed. Compile all the ahk scripts. DONE!
